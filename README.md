# tunician
A mediocre tool for decoding the runic language from the game Tunic

## How To Use

After downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/dresswithpockets/tunician/releases), or building the latest version from source, simply run it and a UI will appear:

The controls are as follows:

```
Left/Right Arrow       Move cursor left and right;
                       moving right at the end of a phrase adds more runes to the phrase

Backspace              Clear current rune & remove it from the phrase

Click                  on the lines in the central rune to toggle them on/off;
                       toggling the diacritic at the bottom will swap phoneme order
```

## Notes & Limitations
 - Empty runes are treated as half-width spaces
 - There is no punctuation support
 - The phrase will cut off if it is too long

## Phonemes 

Huge credit goes to [u/oposdeo](https://www.reddit.com/user/oposdeo) who appears to have done a good chunk of the work of actually decoding the runic code. See their post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TunicGame/comments/tgc056/tunic_language_reference_sheet_big_spoiler/).
